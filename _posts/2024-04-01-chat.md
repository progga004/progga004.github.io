title: "Reliable Chat Application with Custom Transport Protocol"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/chat.png"
description: "This project implements a reliable chat application over UDP by building a custom transport protocol that ensures message delivery even in the presence of packet loss. The project is split into two parts:
<hr>
<b>Basic Chat Application</b>
<p>-Developed a simple chat application using UDP for communication between multiple clients and a server.</p>
<p>- The server tracks active users and relays messages between clients.</p>
<p>- The application supports features like sending messages to multiple users, listing active users, and quitting the chat.</p>
<hr>
<b>Reliable Communication Protocol</b>
<p>- Extended the chat application to include sequence numbers, acknowledgements, and retransmission timers for reliability.</p>
<p>- Messages are split into packets, each containing a header (start, end, data, ack), sequence number, and checksum.</p>
<p>- The protocol retransmits lost packets if not acknowledged within 500 milliseconds, ensuring message integrity and reliable delivery.</p>

This project showcases a reliable message transfer system by implementing core TCP-like functionalities on top of UDP."
