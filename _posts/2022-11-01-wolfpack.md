title: "Packet Handling and Reconstruction using Custom Protocol"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/packet.png"
description: "This project involves creating custom packet structures for reliable message transmission and implementing functions to handle various packet operations, including printing, packetizing, checksum calculation, and message reconstruction.
<hr>
<b>Key Features:</b>
<p>- <b>Packet Creation</b>: Divides a message into multiple packets with source and destination addresses, fragment offsets, and checksum fields for reliable transmission.</p>
<p>- <b>Checksum Calculation</b>: Implements a checksum function to verify the integrity of each packet during transmission and ensure error detection.</p>
<p>- <b>Packet Reconstruction</b>: Reassembles the message by extracting the payload from received packets and combining them in the correct order.</p>
<p>- <b>Packet Validation</b>: Ensures each packet is valid by verifying the checksum before including its payload in the final reconstructed message.</p>

The project focuses on ensuring reliable message transmission and error detection, making it ideal for custom communication protocols."
