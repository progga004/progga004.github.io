description: "The Elevator Simulation in Java is a project that simulates the operation of a multi-story elevator system. The simulation is written in Java and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the simulation and observe the behavior of the elevator system. The elevator simulation uses object-oriented programming principles to model the behavior of the elevator and the building it serves. Users can customize the simulation by specifying the number of floors, the number of elevators, and the maximum capacity of each elevator. One of the unique features of this elevator simulation is its ability to model different elevator scheduling algorithms. Users can choose between various algorithms, such as first-come-first-served, shortest-remaining-time, and priority-based scheduling. This allows users to compare the performance of different scheduling algorithms and evaluate their effectiveness in different scenarios."
