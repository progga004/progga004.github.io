description: "The Hospital Management System - Medical360 is a web-based application designed to manage the operations of a hospital efficiently. The system provides a complete solution for handling user authentication, department and patient management, as well as staff-to-patient assignments. It is built using modern web technologies, offering a user-friendly interface where administrators can create and manage users, departments, and patient records.

One of the key features of the system is its messaging functionality, allowing staff members to communicate securely. The system also tracks each patient's medical history, including who attended to the patient and the treatment provided. Doctors receive notifications for patient assignments, updates, and important reminders, while patients can be scheduled for appointments through an integrated appointment system. The project models real-world hospital workflows, offering tools for resource and staff management, and ensuring seamless operation through notifications and real-time updates. The entire system is deployed on Heroku, ensuring scalability and accessibility for users."
