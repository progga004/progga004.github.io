title: "Versatile Decision Making System"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/tree.png"
description: "This project involves developing a versatile decision-making system utilizing a tree data structure in Java. The system interacts with users by asking a series of questions and based on their answers, it navigates through different branches of the decision tree to provide a tailored output.
<hr>
<b>Key Features</b>:
<p>- <b>Decision Tree Structure</b>: Implements a tree data structure where each node represents a question, and branches lead to different subsequent questions based on user input.</p>
<p>- <b>Interactive Question Flow</b>: Dynamically adjusts the flow of questions according to the responses provided, ensuring personalized decision paths for each user.</p>
<p>- <b>Efficient Data Structure Usage</b>: Leverages the tree data structure for efficient branching and decision-making processes.</p>

The project demonstrates the use of Java and tree data structures to create a flexible and interactive decision-making system."
