title: "Two-Layer Linear Neural Network"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/neural.png"
description: "This project implements a two-layer linear neural network for binary classification tasks using NumPy. The network consists of fully connected layers, ReLU activation, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions. It is designed for simple tasks such as MNIST binary classification. The model includes modules for forward propagation, backpropagation, parameter updates, and inference.

Key features include custom implementation of gradient descent for weight and bias updates, along with flexible initialization of network parameters. The network allows for easy experimentation with different layer configurations and loss functions."
