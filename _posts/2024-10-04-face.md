title: "Communication Board for Cerebral Palsy"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/gaze-est.png"
description: "This ongoing thesis of mine focuses on improving a communication board designed for individuals with cerebral palsy. The project utilizes full-face appearance and gaze estimation to enable more intuitive and accessible communication. By refining the accuracy of gaze estimation, the system aims to track eye movements and facial cues, allowing users to interact with the board more effectively. The project integrates advanced computer vision techniques to help individuals with limited mobility communicate using their gaze and facial expressions.

The current focus is on enhancing gaze estimation accuracy and accumulating it with facial feature analysis to ensure robust performance for real-world applications."
