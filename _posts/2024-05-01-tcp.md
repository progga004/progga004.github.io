title: "TCP Packet Analysis Using PCAP"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/tcp.png"
description: "This project focuses on analyzing TCP flows captured in PCAP (Packet Capture) files using a PCAP library to parse and extract relevant information. The project involves developing a program that characterizes TCP flows and provides insights into flow-level information, congestion control, and retransmission events.
<hr>
<b><u>Key Features</u></b>:
<br>
<p>-<b>TCP Flow Analysis</b>: Parses the PCAP file to identify TCP flows based on source/destination IP addresses and ports, handling multiple concurrent TCP flows.</p>
<p>-<b>Sequence and Acknowledgement Number Extraction</b>: Extracts important TCP-level information such as sequence numbers, acknowledgement numbers, and receive window size for the first two transactions of each TCP flow.</p>
<p>-<b>Throughput Calculation</b>: Computes the sender throughput based on data transfer during the TCP session.</p>
<p><b>-Congestion Control Estimation</b>: Estimates the congestion window size over time and identifies retransmission events due to both triple duplicate acknowledgements and timeouts.</li>
</p>
The project utilizes PCAP programming and flow-level analysis techniques, making it a useful tool for understanding TCP behavior and network traffic."
