title: "Bacon Cipher Encryption and Decryption"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/cipher.png"
description: "This project implements the Bacon Cipher, an encryption technique that encodes messages using a binary-based cipher system. The project includes both encryption and decryption functions, where each letter of the plaintext is converted into a binary string, and then used to encode the ciphertext by manipulating the case of letters. The decryption process involves reading the encoded message, converting the binary sequences back into their corresponding letters, and reconstructing the original plaintext.

The project also handles special cases, such as spaces, punctuation, and numbers, ensuring the accurate reconstruction of messages. It's a great demonstration of classical cryptography and text manipulation."
