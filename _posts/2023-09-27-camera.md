description: "This project is focused on multi-camera human motion capture, particularly on camera calibration, using the Multi-Camera Toolbox. Built upon the EasyMocap repository, this project emphasizes intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration. Key tasks include detecting chessboard keypoints for intrinsic calibration and using AprilTag markers for extrinsic calibration.

I contributed extensively to data annotation, leveraging tools like the VGG image annotator for manual annotation and data collection. The project integrates robust feature detection and calibration techniques, enabling accurate camera parameter estimation for multi-camera setups. The project also includes merging manual annotations with automatic detection results for improved calibration accuracy."
