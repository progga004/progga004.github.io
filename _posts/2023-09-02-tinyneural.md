title: "Neural Network for Classification and Regression"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/neuralclass.png"
description: "This project implements a flexible neural network framework using NumPy, designed for binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression tasks. The network supports custom layers such as Linear, ReLU, and Sigmoid, and various loss functions including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Binary Cross-Entropy, and Cross-Entropy for multiclass classification.
<hr>
The models can be configured for different architectures, making it adaptable for various tasks. The project provides detailed implementations of forward and backward propagation, parameter updates, and gradient calculation, making it suitable for educational and experimental purposes."
