title: "Web Server and Proxy Server Development"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/proxy.png"
description: "This project involves the development of two key components: a basic web server and a web proxy server, both using socket programming in Python.
<hr>
The web server is designed to handle one HTTP request at a time. It accepts and parses incoming HTTP requests, retrieves the requested files from the serverâ€™s file system, and creates an HTTP response message that is sent back to the client. The server supports both text and image (jpeg, png) file requests. If the requested file is not found, the server responds with a '404 Not Found' error. This project covers the core concepts of socket programming and HTTP header formatting.
<hr>
The web proxy server handles client requests by caching web pages to improve performance. It processes simple GET requests and handles different types of objects, including HTML pages and images. The proxy forwards client requests to the web server and caches the responses to serve future requests efficiently. The project demonstrates key functionalities of proxy servers, including request forwarding and caching, providing insights into enhancing network performance.

Both components demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of networking, HTTP communication, and efficient resource handling."
