description: "Image Mosaic Creation is a project that demonstrates the use of advanced computer vision techniques to create a panoramic mosaic by seamlessly stitching two images together. The project involves detecting corners in the source and destination images, matching features between them, and computing a homography matrix to align the images. Using the RANSAC algorithm, robust feature matching and inlier detection are performed to ensure accurate alignment. The images are then warped and blended using feathering techniques to create a smooth, unified mosaic.

Key techniques include corner detection for identifying significant points, feature matching with Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC), and image warping using homography. The project also implements feathering for smooth blending between images, making the mosaic appear seamless."
