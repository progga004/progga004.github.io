      Hi, I'm <strong>Progga Paromita Dutta</strong> from Bangladesh, currently residing in the USA. I am passionate about technology and data science, and I am excited to explore new opportunities in this dynamic field.
    </p>

    <p class="styled-about-me">
      I began my undergraduate journey as a transfer student at Stony Brook University in Spring 2022, where I am currently a senior, double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics. I am set to graduate in December 2024. Prior to my studies at Stony Brook, I pursued Mechanical Engineering at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), which laid the foundation for my analytical and problem-solving skills.
    </p>

    <p class="styled-about-me">
      Beyond academics, I am actively involved in campus life as a ballroom dancer and a member of the Stony Brook University Ballroom Team. I have competed in prestigious competitions at Harvard and Tufts. Additionally, I am a proud member of Women in Computer Science (WiCS) and the Stony Brook Computing Society (SBCS), where I engage with a vibrant community of peers who share my enthusiasm for technology and innovation.

  <h2>My Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    My journey began with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, but I found myself drawn to the exciting field of AI and its potential to change the world. I was particularly fascinated by the intersection of AI and the metaverse, and the ways in which virtual reality and AI can combine to create immersive and engaging experiences. Eventually, I changed my major to pursue this field.

    My motivation to pursue this field comes from a deep belief that AI can be used to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change, healthcare, and education. By harnessing the power of AI, we can create more efficient, sustainable, and equitable systems that benefit everyone.
